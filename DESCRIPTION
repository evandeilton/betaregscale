Description: Maximum-likelihood estimation of beta regression models for
    responses derived from bounded rating scales. Observations are treated
    as interval-censored on (0, 1) after a scale-to-unit transformation,
    and the likelihood is built from the difference of the beta CDF at the
    interval endpoints. The complete likelihood supports mixed censoring
    types: uncensored, left-censored, right-censored, and
    interval-censored observations (Lopes, 2024). Both fixed- and
    variable-dispersion submodels are supported, with flexible link
    functions for the mean and precision components. A compiled C++ backend
    (via 'Rcpp' and 'RcppArmadillo') provides numerically stable,
    high-performance log-likelihood evaluation. Standard S3 methods
    (print, summary, coef, fitted, residuals, predict, plot, confint,
    vcov, logLik, AIC, BIC) are available for fitted objects.
